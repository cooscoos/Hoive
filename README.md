# Hoive
The boardgame Hive, written in Rust.

## To do

### Ant (and the ant squeeze rule)

We now have ant_close, a function that has logic to prevent the white ant from entering the pit shown in image
![ant squeeze](/reference/ant_squeeze.jpeg "ant squeeze")

This is about as complicated a situation as we'll ever see.

Now just need to tidy up what's been written, and apply this logic to the ant chips

* (Later) spider and bee similar, but with movement range, see https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/
