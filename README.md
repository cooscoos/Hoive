# Hoive
The boardgame [Hive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hive_(game)), written in Rust.

Play the game in terminal with cargo run.

## To do
### Bugcheck and tidy up

- make the chips in hand display a bit nicer, labelled subsections for different animals
- play test
- does pillbug sumoing need a bee check for either party?

### Online
Make hostable on server so can play on internet with observers
<!-- 
### "House rules"
Then it might be "fun" to add new animals in a non-standard version of the game e.g.:

* a centipede that can remove any adjacent (non-flying) animal permanently from that game (but then also dies), maybe also has limited moveset - moves like ladybird but with only 2 moves. Mosquitos copying centipede must die if used like centipede.
* a housefly that can move anywhere (including into small gaps an ant can't reach) for one turn (and then must fly back - if it can't return to its original spot, it dies for that game or is returned to player hand). Maybe it doesn't need to die or return, maybe it can fly freely but never land adjacent to bees or maybe even spiders so that you need to defend bee / other peices with spider. Maybe both are cool, I dunno.
* maybe other people have made custom hive peices that we can implement, search later.
