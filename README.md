# Hoive
The boardgame Hive, written in Rust.

## To do

### Ant path planning (and ant squeeze rule)

Player moves ant peice from A to B, game should generate a path or route.
Game then needs to check if every move along that path is legal
New constraint to add is don't let ants squeeze through tiny gaps
Ant, spider and bee all use "ant path planning" - just have different no. of moves
