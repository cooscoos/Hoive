snapshot_7: a copy of /tests/common/games.rs fn game_snapshot_7
badsnapshot_7: as above but the last move is incorrect in the csv
snapshot_8: set up for pillbug tries to sumo after moving (try sumo q1 to 0,2)
snapshot_9: set up for pillbug tries to sumo another chip that recently moved (try sumo ba1 to -1,-1), breaking hive (try sumo wa1 to 1,1), ok= not break the hive (try sumo wa1 to 0,2)
snapshot_10: set up for pillbug tries to sumo into non-neighbouring hex (try sumo a1 to 2,0)
snapshot_5neighbours: wa1 has 5 neighbours. for benchmarking counting.
snapshot_11: wb1 on top of bq1, trying to place a black chip at 1,3 should result in bad neighbour because of opposing beetle covering queen
snapshot_12: try move wb1 to -1,-1, should be too small a gap
snapshot_13: testing history's ability to deal with skipped turns, p1 at 1,1 should be able to sumo a1 at 0,2 to 2,0 because of skipped turns
snapshot_14: use wp1 at 0,-4 to sumo bb1 at 0,-2 (layer 1) to 1,-5, or to sumo wq1 at 0,-2 (layer 0) should return not-neighbour or beetle-stack
snapshot_15: beetle gate. (there's an image of this board in ../images)
            a) Try move bb2 to 0,-2 (fine) then through a beetle gate to 0,0 (not fine)
            b) use wp1 at 0,-2 to sumo ba1 at 0,0 to 0,-4 should not be allowed because of beetle gate
